## I'm Ashton and I believe in documentation as a product.

Over the past decade I have worked on a range of projects, including:

<ol class="test">
    <li>Robotic Process Automation.</li>
    <li>SDK Documentation for the Google Assistant.</li>
    <li>Technical Specifications and API docs for content delivery into the HBO Max media pipeline.</li>
    <li>Web/CICD Development for HBO's Documentation Management System.</li>
    <li>Data Science and Storytelling with data at Amazon</li>
</ol>

Here you will find a collection of projects that I have worked on over the past few years. For each example in my portfolio I was the sole author (unless otherwise indicated).
While my positions typically required me to be the sole author or developer, the efforts were rarely achieved alone. Colloaborating with Engineers, Designers, Legal teams, and 
product teams have become a must in my world, and I wouldn't change that for anything.

If you have any questions, need assistance with technical documentation, or want a documentation portal configured and implemented, feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn or by email.

## I'm Ashton and I believe in documentation as a product.

Over the past decade I have worked on a range of projects, including:

<ol class="test">
    <li>Robotic Process Automation.</li>
    <li>SDK Documentation for the Google Assistant.</li>
    <li>Technical Specifications and API docs for content delivery into the HBO Max media pipeline.</li>
    <li>Web/CICD Development for HBO's Documentation Management System.</li>
    <li>Data Science and Storytelling with data at Amazon and Hearst.</li>
</ol>

Here you will find a collection of documentation products that I have worked on over the past few years. While my positions typically required sole authorhip/development the efforts were rarely achieved alone. Colloaborating with Engineers, Designers, Legal teams, and 
product teams have become a must in my world, and much of my work reflects this reality.

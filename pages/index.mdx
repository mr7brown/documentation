## I'm Ashton and I believe in documentation as a product.

Here you will find a collection of documentation products that I have worked on over the past few years. While my positions typically required sole authorship/development the efforts were rarely achieved alone. Colloaborating with Engineers, Designers, Legal teams, and 
product teams have become a must in my world, and much of my work reflects this reality.

Over the past decade I have worked on a range of projects, including:

1. Robotic Process Automation.
1. SDK Documentation for the Google Assistant.
1. Technical Specifications and API docs for content delivery into the HBO Max media pipeline.
1. Web/CICD Development for HBO's Documentation Management System.
1. Data Science and Storytelling with data at Amazon and Hearst.
If you have any questions, need assistance with technical documentation, or want a documentation portal configured and implemented, feel free to connect with me by [email](mailto:ashtonbrownmba@gmail) or on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ashton-brown-mba-6000238a/)

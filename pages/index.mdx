 
Here you will find a collection of projects that I have worked on over the past few years. 
For each example in my portfolio I was the sole author, but the majority of the docs required a coordinated effort to `draft`, `push`, `merge`, and `publish`. Similar to the flow below.

If you have any questions, need assistance with technical documentation, or want a documentation portal configured and implemented, feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn or by email.

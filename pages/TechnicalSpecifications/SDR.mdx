## HBO Standard-Definition Range Content Specification

The purpose of this document is to facilitate and define **WarnerMedia's** requirements for the successful acquisition of Standard Dynamic Range (SDR) Licensed Content from external parties. This specification establishes the composition and technical requirements for all aspects of the delivery to which external parties must comply to complete the content acquisition process.

This specification is not intended to provide guidance on delivering High Dynamic Range, Stereoscopic 3D or multi-language component content to **WarnerMedia**. For additional Contribution Specifications covering these deliveries please reach out to **WarnerMedia**.

### Quality Requirements

It is **WarnerMedia's** intent to acquire the highest quality masters that preserve the original artistic intent while providing a premium viewing experience to the consumer. To meet **WarnerMedia's** perceptual and measured quality standards content delivered must conform to the specifications outlined in this document. In preparing content for delivery and to preserve the highest quality it is strongly preferred that all unnecessary transformations or processing that results in the degradation to the master quality be avoided.

### Expected Deliverables

A complete and valid delivery SHALL include:

1. Master File (JPEG 2000 MXF OP1a or ProRes 422 HQ)
2. English Closed Caption file (.scc)
3. Latin Spanish Closed Caption file (.scc)
4. Descriptive Metadata
5. Images / Artwork

### Master Technical Specifications

1. Content MUST be delivered in the Native Frame Rate and Original Aspect Ratio.
2. Native SD content MUST be upconverted and delivered as HD (1920x1080) with pillar-box.
3. Content finished as UHD SHOULD be delivered as UHD. Note that UHD content will be presented as HD until such time as the service supports UHD.
4. The frame rate MUST be both continuous and constant throughout the duration of the program.
5. Theatrical content MUST be delivered as a continuous program. Theatrical content formatted with Ad breaks will be rejected.
6. Episodic content MAY be delivered formatted with Ad breaks ONLY if a continuous program is not available. Ad break duration SHOULD be 15 frames but MUST NOT exceed 1 second from the beginning of fade down to end of fade up.
7. Metadata in the file header MUST accurately indicate:

- Scan Type
- Scan Order
- Display Aspect Ratio
